# 简介

To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:

> a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and decommissioning;

> b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)];

> c) uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable residual risk;

> d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification,validation and confirmation measures; and

> e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.

# ISO 26262-5-2018（硬件）

The necessary activities and processes for the product development at the hardware level include:
— the hardware implementation of the technical safety concept;
— the analysis of potential hardware faults and their effects; and
— the coordination with software development.
